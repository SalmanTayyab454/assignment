This is a simple React app that lets you filter and compare bank accounts from different providers.

Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository and run npm install to install all the dependencies. You can then start the development server by running npm start.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-awesome-react-app.git
cd my-awesome-react-app
npm install
npm start
This will start the app in development mode on http://localhost:3000. You should see the app running in the browser.

Features
This app allows you to filter bank accounts based on two criteria: Kontogeb√ºhren and Kontofeature.

The app provides a list of bank accounts from different providers, and allows you to filter them based on whether they have no fees, a starting bonus, or other features. You can also filter them based on whether they offer a shared account, or have no minimum deposit requirements.

Once you have applied a filter, the app will update the list of bank accounts to show only those that match the selected criteria.
